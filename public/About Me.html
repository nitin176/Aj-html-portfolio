<p>One of the most common competency-based questions for any role requiring some project management experience is “Describe an important project you’ve worked on.”

  There are a few reasons why interviewers ask this question. They want to see how well you can manage a project or a situation, what your approach to dealing with challenges is, and how your skills would help you to successfully lead a project. They also want to know what your work ethic is like, and gain insight into how you handle stress. So how are you going to answer this question?</p>

<p>It can be easy to begin rambling about an important project or achievement from a current or previous position when in an interview situation. Stay clear and concise by avoiding these mistakes and pitfalls. Do not go into an interview situation without an answer to this question firmly planted in your head. As noted at the beginning of the article, you should write out a list of all the important projects you’ve worked on in your career, and detail how you contributed to their successful completions. Choose a past project that aligns with the job/industry you’re interviewing for.</p>
